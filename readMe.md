# FT_LINEAR_REGRESSION

Specialization school project 42 :

This project aims to introduce the concept of machine learning.

Objective: Implement a linear regression to predict the price of a car in relation to its mileage.

## Prerequisites
- [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html)

## For Launch

```python train_LR [-p] [-f]```
- -p == display the plots with the training results
- -f == add a file name to analyze (by default, it's the data.csv file given with the git clone)

next

```python predict_LR```
